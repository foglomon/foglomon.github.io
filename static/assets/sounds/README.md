# Audio Files Placeholder

Please replace these placeholder files with your actual mechanical keyboard sound files:

- mech1.m4a - First mechanical key sound
- mech2.m4a - Second mechanical key sound
- mech3.m4a - Third mechanical key sound

The application will randomly play one of these three sounds when a key is pressed.

## File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Duration: Short (0.1-0.5 seconds recommended)
- Quality: Good enough for web playback
- Size: Keep files small for faster loading

## Current Status

Placeholder files are in place. The application will gracefully handle missing audio files by not playing sounds, but all other functionality will work normally.
